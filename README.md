## Introduction 
Designed for gender advisors, data specialists, and other development professionals, Gender Data 101 Edition 2.0 is a 5-week blended online course featuring live events with gender and data experts that unpacks complex and practical considerations to understand, use, and share gender data with the ultimate goal of impact. Some of the exercises I complete(d) during the course will be available here for public viewing. The material will be organized by week and will reflect the activity I choose to complete (as oppose to all the rich available activies the course offers each week). 

My hope is that by creating this repository 1) others can benefit from some of the engaging questions asked in the course and 2) I can record my own journey as an intentional and progressive data professional. Thank you for visiting and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

### Course Objectives
1. Define best practices needed for gender data at all stages of the data life cycle: collection, processing, analysis, visualization, uptake, and impact.
2. Identify the multiple forms of systemic discrimination that affect the overall efficacy of gender data 
3. Evaluate the limitations of the gender binary and how it may affect the phases of the gender data lifecycle
4. Create action-oriented strategies and an intersectional approach to combat gender data inequities and biases

### Disclosure
The framing of the activites and objectives will be quotes or paraphrased, so much of the framework here is the intellectual mentorship/property/paradigm of the course leaders. The answers to the activities are my work.
